                This research is focused on the study of interaction kernels for interaction dynamics. The paper "Nonparametric inference of interaction laws in systems of agents 
                from trajectory data", by Fei Lu et al, was primarily used as a basis for this research. Using algorithms to compute learning matricies and solve linear systems
                in order to investigate the potential source interaction kernel for a dynamic system. The links to the paper and associated appendix can be found below.

                The above opinion dynamics simulations were created using the interaction kernel from the research appendix.
                This simulation represents the attraction influence of people on each other and how consensus can form.
                The method used for simulation and the subsequent learning of the source interaction kernel is dimensionally independent
                and thus the 1 dimensional and 2 dimensional simulations are shown here to represent that.

                The simulation above has been obtained by attempting to determine the interaction kernel governing the simulation
                by utilizing the following algorithm:

            <img id="algoimg" src="Images/algorithm1.png" alt="Algorithm for learning interaction kernels from observations">
            <p>
                This algorithm determines coefficients for basis functions that are then used to recreate the opinion dynamics 
                simulation. This new simulation is then compared to one of the trajectories used to learn the kernel to determine 
                success of the algorithm. The strength of the kernel at varying pairwise distances (r) are also compared to evaluate
                the algorithm.

            <p>
                Currently the least squares algorithm over estimates the coefficients for the basis functions. This is what results
                in the fast condensation of the individual particles along with the significant differential between the two kernels.

                These simulations are generated in a similar manner to the opinion dynamics simulations. The main difference comes 
                from the function of the governing kernel. In the Lennard-Jones simulation, the particles repulse instead of attract. 
                This type of simulation is mainly used in particle simulations that represent atomic systems since the kernel can 
                represent the Pauli repulsion force and the van der Waals force depending on the pairwise distance.
