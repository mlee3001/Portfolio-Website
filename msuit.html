            <p>
                I have held this position since September of 2023 and have taken part in many
                projects and programs to assist in improvement of customer technology in the Michigan
                State University Student Life & Engagement department. My team is under the Digital
                Strategies & Services department which houses all of the different IT teams for MSU SLE.
                Our team is the "Tech Team" and is the group in charge of hands-on deployment and maintence
                of our IT systems. This includes customer PCs, laptops, digital signage, workstation setups, 
                security cameras, conference room setups, printers, and more. This wide variety of tasks has
                taught me many different skills and has allowed me the chance to work with many different
                types of technology.
            </p>
